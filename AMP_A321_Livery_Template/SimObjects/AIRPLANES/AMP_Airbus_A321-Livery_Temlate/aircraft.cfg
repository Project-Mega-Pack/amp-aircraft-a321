description = "The Airbus A321 is a stretched version of Airbus best-selling short- and medium-range A320. The A321 has a slightly increased wing area, stronger landing gear with larger tires, and engines with increased thrust. When the A321 entered service in 1988, it pioneered the use of �glass cockpit� instrumentation, the first digital fly-by-wire control system used in an airliner, and sidestick controllers." ; Variation description.
